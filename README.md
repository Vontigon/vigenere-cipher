# vigenere-cipher
My take on the vigenere cipher

Both a Linux terminal and a Pycharm (what I use) version are available. The vcipher takes a message and deciphers it using a key provided by the user. It can also take that encoded message an decode back into plaintext using that same key (otherwise it'd be garbled).
